    <p class="p11">Hi I'm a Frontend Web Developer building the Front-end of Websites that leads to the 
        success of the overall product. Check out some of my work in the Projects section.
    <br><br>
    Iâ€™ve just graduated from computer science. Looking for my first job, I decided to go with  web development, since I understand that it is impossible to succeed in almost any business without some online presence. Hence I know the opportunities are there and will stay there. I specialize    in creating websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills and experience then don't hesitate to contact me.
